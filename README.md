# Gaia2

A colour particle simulator and chaos generator

### Welcome to the Wonderful World of particle movement

*in balance exists chaos*

Each pixel holds a particle, each with an unique colour.  
Particles of similar colour are attracted to each other.  
In their movement they push others out of the way.  
Those two opposing forces can find an unstable balance like the horizons in fractals.

The video starts with a slowed down rendering of a single frame.  
You see the rendering "horizon" rippling (zig-zagging) from the center to the edge.

There are 912681 particles and more than 40 million pixel movements per frame.
